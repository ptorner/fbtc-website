        <p>FBTC Invest AB was established in 2016 by a group of friends and colleagues. Today, FBTC is owned and operated by a dedicated team of individuals with diverse backgrounds in fields such as telecom, investment banking, management consulting, fintech/payments, IT security and more.<br><br>

          We invest solely in unlisted growth/start-up companies, mainly where software is central to the company business model, preferably in a clearly defined niche which is under transformation. Holding period has no limit. We embrace a long-term approach and are prepared to hold the investment for many years. We are keen, as an owner, to share and utilise our knowledge and network where needed.<br><br>

          Sweetspot investment is preferably between SEK 0.5M to SEK 2.0M per investment and have the ability to follow the investment during the holding period through additional capital injections.<br><br>
